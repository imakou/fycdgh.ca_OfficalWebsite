            <p class="text-white text-left mb-4">
              I-Kuan Tao (also known as Yi-Guan Dao) (hereinafter referred to as “IKT”) is a modern faith
              based on the belief in Tao (or Dao), the eternal source. The Chinese words “I-Kuan Tao” can be
              roughly translated as the Principles from One Unity. IKT embodies the truths inherited from the
              teachings of Lao Tzu, Confucius and Buddha, which are the same truths taught by some other
              spiritual and philosophical traditions. From Lao Tzu comes the reliance on harmony of people and
              nature, from Confucius comes the appreciation of good deeds and behaviours and from Buddha comes
              the general concern for the masses and delivering all from suffering.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white text-left mb-4">
              The modern movement of IKT was established by Zhong-Yi Lu, the 17th Patriarch of the later stage
              of the East Tao Orthodoxy. In 1930, his disciples Guang-Bi Zhang and Hui-Ming Sun became the
              18th Patriarchs to carry on the Tao Orthodoxy. In order to preach the great Tao and reveal
              enlightenment to all humanity, the 18th Patriarchs established and taught the Principles of the
              Tao as follows:
            </p>

                (filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, truthfulness, courtesy, righteousness, integrity and a

              <li>
                To follow the ancient practice of the Four Ethics (courtesy, righteousness, integrity and a
                sense of shame), the Mainstays (between sovereign and minister, parents and children, husband
                and wife), and the Constant Virtues (benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom and
                truthfulness).

              <li>To cleanse the mind and purify the spirit.</li>

            </ol>
            <p class="text-white text-left mb-4">
              IKT identifies the common principles underlying Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity and
              Islam, and, in particular, applies the modern teachings of the Holy Scriptures composed with
              heavenly decree in its rites, ceremonies and instruction. IKT believes in a Heavenly Mater
              beyond all other gods, called Ming-ming Shang-ti (the God of Clarity), who gives birth to
              everyone’s true-self (i.e., the Tao within us). By enlightening individual’s Tao, the
              “increasing chaos” of modern times can be defeated by everyone’s Tao, and the world can live
              peacefully in harmony. Because IKT embraces principles of non-Chinese religions, it is not
              restricted to Chinese cultures. Although the Tao movement originated in twentieth-century China,
              it migrated in the early 50's to Hong Kong and Taiwan, and now is one of the most popular faiths
              in Taiwan. To accommodate the growing population and diverse cultural climate of Canada, the
              Fa-Yi Chong-De Guang-Hui Association (the “Association”) propagates the teachings of IKT (for
              example, the IKT ideals of benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom and faith) in Canada.

                Fa-Yi Chong-De Guang-Hui Association (the “Association”) is a registered religious charity
                (Registration No.: 818138869 RR 0001) effective January 1, 2013. The purpose of the
                Association is to (1) preach and advance the teachings of the IKT faith; (2) establish,
                maintain and support houses of worship in the IKT faith; and (3) establish and maintain an IKT
                school of instruction.

                1. Preach and advance the teachings of the IKT faith
              </h5>
              <p class="text-white text-left mb-4">
                To educate IKT cultivators with the IKT teachings is the primary goal of the Association. A
                cultivator starts their IKT education through Tao Enlightenment Ceremony to discover their
                True-self (i.e., the Tao within us). It is then followed by a two-day Holy Meeting in IKT.
                Lecture topics include the Essence of True-self, Supreme Preciousness of Tao, Is Tao a
                Religion, True Meaning of Life, Cultivation of Internal and External Virtues, Filial Piety,
                Essence of Vegetarianism, Lineage of Tao and Holy Teachers, Heavenly Mater’s Grace and Virtues
                of Patriarchs, and Faith, Vows, Cultivation and Realization.
                <br />
                <br />
                After the two-day Holy Meeting, IKT cultivators are enrolled in a five (5) year education
                program, which is accomplished by lectures, seminars, group discussions and volunteer work
                based on the curriculum designed by the
                <a href="http://www.iktcds.edu.tw/Chong-De-School/EN/1-1-1-Established.htm"
                  >IKT Chong-De School
                </a>
                in Taiwan. Lectures are conducted weekly or by-weekly by qualified lecturers who completed
                five (5) years of Tao education and changed themselves to encompass the essences, disciplines
                and doctrines of Tao in their daily life. Lecturer’s contributions are on a voluntary basis
                and are not financially compensated by the Association. As personal sublimation and a life of
                service are the key practices in IKT moral philosophy, adherents devote a great deal of time
                and resources to social work within their communities.
              </p>
              <h5 class="text-white text-left">
                2. Establish, maintain and support houses of worship in the IKT faith
              </h5>
              <p class="text-white text-left mb-4">
                The IKT faith is practised individually and in group meeting in houses of worship (“Temples”).
                In Ontario, there have been two (2) Temples established – one is located at 421 Nugget Ave.,
                Unit 3, Scarborough, ON M1S 4L8 and the other is located at 2450 Sheppard Ave. East, Toronto,
                ON M2J 1X1. The set-up of a third Temple in Hamilton is under preparation. By increasing the
                number of IKT Temples, the Association are bringing the Buddhist “Western Paradise” to earth
                and creating a world of brotherhood and universal love as envisioned by Confucian teachings.
              </p>
              <h5 class="text-white text-left">
                3. Establish and maintain an IKT school of instruction
              </h5>
              <p class="text-white text-left mb-4">
                As set out above, IKT is based on an educational process to enlightenment. Accordingly, the
                Association intends to offer classes in its Temples for children, youth (after-school) and
                interested adults to educate them in the principles and aspects of IKT including the meaning
                of life, understanding one's self and vegetarianism. The curriculum for such classes will be
                developed by the Association to meet the specific needs of each Temple, its members and
                surrounding community.
